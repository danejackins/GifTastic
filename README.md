#What the project does
  This is a page dedicated to superheros! Combining cartoons from childhood and the onslaught of comic-book-movies, this project lets you celebrate your favorite superhero!

#Why the project is useful
  This project is useful because it allows fanboys quick and easy access to the most popular gifs and images of their most favorite superhero. This project also allowed for practice with apis, apis keeps, and how to incorporate those into javascript.

#How users can get started with the project
  Get started by clicking on your favorite superhero's button! Not a Marvel fan (there's only one DC hero up there, and he may not be your favorite either!)? Type the name of your superhero into the "search for a superhero" box and add your favorite masked crusader to the page. 

#Where users can get help with your project
  Talk with me! You can email me with your questions at dane.jackins@gmail.com. But do not fret, dear reader, this interface is ingenious in its simplicity.

#Who maintains and contributes to the project
